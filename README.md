# PEACE :v:: Prompt Engineering Automation for CLIPSeg Enhancement

This work is an extenion of DOVESEI (https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11471), where we improved on the prompt generation and engineering inside DOVESEI. The objective was to generate prompts that are dynamic, such that prompts are adaptive to observed images instead of a static prompt. In addition, they are automatically engineered to describe the observed images better.
